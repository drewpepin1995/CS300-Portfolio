# CS300-Portfolio
- What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?
The problems I was solving in the projects for this course was using different data structure methods to solve the presented problems. Using Vectors, Hash Tables, and Binary Trees I was able to build a college course application. 
- How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.
Data structures are important to understand because it allows you to build an algorithm that solves a particular problem in the optimal amount of time. I approached the given problems from the projects in this course by breaking them down into smaller, simpler tasks, eventually solving the main overarching problem. 
- How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?
To overcome roadblocks, I went back and used the resourses given to me throughout the course, like ZYBooks and the readings. I also tried approaching the problems I ran into differently when I was stuck for a long period of time. 
- How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?
The work on both projects has helped my development as a coder tremendously, as I now have a better understanding of algorithms and solving issues optimally. I also feel more comfortable using different data structures which are crucial when building applications. 
- How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
My work on project 1 and project 2 helped me gain confidence in my ability to write and mainain readable code. Having consistent code helps not only you, but any future developer who could work on the same application and need to build off your existing code.
